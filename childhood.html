            <h1>My Childhood</h1>
            
            <h2>A Normal Girl with Adaptable Spirit</h2>
            <p>I grew up as a normal girl who believed I could adapt to working in any field  except medicine. That adaptability has been my greatest strength, allowing me to explore different interests and find my path.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Finding My Path</h2>
            <p>I never did any tech subjects until university. Coming to campus, I was completely blank on where to start. The tech world seemed overwhelming and confusing to follow a path. There were so many languages, frameworks, and directions  it was hard to know where to begin.</p>
            
            <div class="value-card">
                <h3>The Turning Point</h3>
                <p>The breakthrough came when I stopped trying to follow everyone else's path and started creating my own. I learned that in technology, it's okay to start confused , everyone does. What matters is starting.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Early Values That Shaped Me</h2>
            <div class="skills-container">
                <span class="skill-tag">Adaptability</span>
                <span class="skill-tag">Curiosity</span>
                <span class="skill-tag">Persistence</span>
                <span class="skill-tag">Learning Mindset</span>
                <span class="skill-tag">Finding Joy in Work</span>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Why This Matters Now</h2>
            <p>My childhood taught me that confusion is just part of the journey. Starting software engineering with zero background was intimidating, but that early lesson about making things interesting kept me going. Now, I'm loving it </p>
            
            <p>That normal girl who could adapt to anything learned that tech isn't about knowing everything from the start. It's about being willing to learn, relearn, and find the interesting parts that keep you engaged.</p>
