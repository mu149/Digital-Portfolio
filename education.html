            <h1>My Education Journey</h1>
            
            <h2>Starting from Zero</h2>
            <p>I began my tech journey at <strong>Kirinyaga University</strong> studying Software Engineering with absolutely no background in technology. No prior coding experience, no tech subjects in high school just curiosity (rumours that engineers have sleepless nights when coding).</p>
            
            <p>The first semester was overwhelming. Everyone seemed to know terms and concepts I'd never heard before. I was <strong>"blank on where to start"</strong> and found it <strong>"hard and confusing to follow a path."</strong></p>
            
            <div class="value-card">
                <h3>The Learning Breakthrough</h3>
                <p>I realized tech isn't about knowing everything from the start. It's about embracing the confusion, asking questions, and building one concept at a time. I started making learning interesting by working on small projects that mattered to me.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>What I'm Learning Now</h2>
            <p>Currently, I'm focusing on both software engineering fundamentals and data analytics:</p>
            
            <div class="skills-container">
                <span class="skill-tag">Front-end Development</span>
                <span class="skill-tag">React & JavaScript</span>
                <span class="skill-tag">Data Visualization</span>
                <span class="skill-tag">API Integration</span>
                <span class="skill-tag">Statistics</span>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Why Statistics and Data?</h2>
            <p>I discovered I love statistics and understanding <strong>"why things or rather data are happening the way they are."</strong> There's something powerful about getting to the root of problems and finding patterns in data.</p>
            
            <p>This interest in data analysis complements my software engineering studies perfectly - I can build the tools AND analyze what they reveal.</p>
            
            <h2>Current Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weather Dashboard:</strong> A React app that's challenging with evolving languages</li>
                <li><strong>Number Converter:</strong> Practical tool to understand different data representations</li>
                <li><strong>Data Analysis Exercises:</strong> Working with real datasets to find insights</li>
                <li><strong>This Portfolio:</strong> Applying what I learn to build something meaningful</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Learning Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I believe in <strong>"learning and relearning."</strong> Technology evolves fast, and what matters isn't memorizing everything, but developing the skills to learn whatever comes next.</p>
            
            <p>Most importantly: <strong>"You must make what you're doing interesting so that you do your best."</strong> This mindset keeps me engaged even when concepts are challenging.</p>
